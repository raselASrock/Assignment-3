              <h1 class="fw-bold text-center">Frequently Asked Question</h1>
              <p class="text-center my-4">A frequently asked questions (FAQ) list is often used in articles, websites, email lists, and online forums where common questions tend to recur, for example through posts or queries by new users related to common knowledge gaps. The purpose of a FAQ is generally to provide information on frequent questions or concerns; however, the format is a useful means of organizing information, and text consisting of questions and their answers may thus be called a FAQ regardless of whether the questions are actually frequently asked.[1]

                Since the acronym FAQ originated in textual media, its pronunciation varies. FAQ is most commonly pronounced[according to whom?] as an initialism, "F-A-Q", but may also be pronounced as an acronym, "FAQ".[2] Web designers often label a single list of questions as a "FAQ", such as on Google Search,[3] while using "FAQs" to denote multiple lists of questions such as on United States Treasury sites.[4] Use of "FAQ" to refer to a single frequently asked question, in and of itself, is less common.</p>

                    <strong>The main differences between Flexbox and CSS Grid: </strong> Dimensions define the primary demarcation between Flexbox and CSS Grid. Flexbox was designed specifically for one-dimensional layouts, while CSS Grid is engineered to enable two-dimensional layouts. Therefore, CSS Grid can easily render rows and columns simultaneously.In layperson’s terms, CSS Grid presents a larger canvas, while Flexbox offers minute functionality that operates in a restricted space. The grids have been designed for a two-dimensional organization.However, the two specifications share some common points, and if you know how to use flexible boxes, you will find some concepts that will help you to grasp CSS grids.The flexible box module has been designed as a one-dimensional presentation model and as a method that can provide space distribution between interface elements and powerful alignment functions. When we describe the flexbox as one-dimensional, we describe the fact that flexbox processes layouts in one dimension at a time, as a row or column. This can be compared to the two-dimensional model of the CSS grid layout, which controls columns and rows together.Dimensions define the primary demarcation between Flexbox and CSS Grid.

                    <strong>Difference Between Bootstrap and Tailwind:</strong> To create an interface between computers and people, developers use front-end frameworks. These frameworks are designed and developed to create sites for people. They allow developers and users to have adequate control. Bootstrap and Tailwind are also two such CSS front-end frameworks used on a large scale. No single web developer is not familiar with these two platforms.Bootstrap was originally released on August 19, 2011. It was initially created by designers and developers at Twitter and used to be known as “Twitter Blueprint”. After Twitter held their own hackathon and publicized the project as an open-sourced framework, the project snowballed as other developers pitched in to help its development. Bootstrap remains free and open-source under the MIT license.

                    The Bootstrap framework can best be described as a component-based framework. Component-based CSS frameworks are made up of predefined components, or parts, that can be used to style HTML, making responsive website development faster and easier.Tailwind CSS’s first alpha release was on November 1, 2017 according to its GitHub release history. After 43 more releases and over 2,200 commits from 88 contributors, the first stable release, Tailwind CSS v1.0, was made on May 13, 2019. Like Bootstrap, Tailwind is a free, open-source project with a MIT license.

                    Tailwind CSS can best be described as a “utility-first” framework. Utility-first frameworks are composed of small, simple classes that can be applied to elements to create a user interface or UI. On the surface, using Tailwind doesn’t look too different from writing inline styles. However, what this framework offers is customizability. Instead of being restrained by the premade components from Bootstrap, you can essentially create your own UI with Tailwind to meet your project’s needs.

                    <strong>Introduction to the CSS basic box model</strong> When laying out a document, the browser's rendering engine represents each element as a rectangular box according to the standard CSS basic box model. CSS determines the size, position, and properties (color, background, border size, etc.) of these boxes.

                    Every box is composed of four parts (or areas), defined by their respective edges: the content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge.The border area, bounded by the border edge, extends the padding area to include the element's borders. Its dimensions are the border-box width and the border-box height.

                    The thickness of the borders are determined by the border-width and shorthand border properties. If the box-sizing property is set to border-box, the border area's size can be explicitly defined with the width, min-width, max-width, height, min-height, and max-height properties. When there is a background (background-color or background-image) set on a box, it extends to the outer edge of the border (i.e. extends underneath the border in z-ordering). This default behavior can be altered with the background-clip CSS property.The margin area, bounded by the margin edge, extends the border area to include an empty area used to separate the element from its neighbors. Its dimensions are the margin-box width and the margin-box height.

                    The size of the margin area is determined by the margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left, and shorthand margin properties. When margin collapsing occurs, the margin area is not clearly defined since margins are shared between boxes.
                    
                    Finally, note that for non-replaced inline elements, the amount of space taken up (the contribution to the height of the line) is determined by the line-height property, even though the borders and padding are still displayed around the content.

                    4.What is a Semantic Tag In HTML-5?

                    <strong>An important principle in web design is the idea of using HTML elements to indicate what they actually are, rather than how they may appear in the browser by default. This is known as using semantic HTML.</strong> The benefit of writing semantic HTML stems from what should be the driving goal of any web page: the desire to communicate. By adding semantic tags to your document, you provide additional information about that document, which aids in communication. Specifically, semantic tags make it clear to the browser what the meaning of a page and its content is. That clarity is also communicated with search engines, ensuring that the right pages are delivered for the right queries.


                    Semantic HTML tags provide information about the contents of those tags that goes beyond just how they look on a page. Text that is enclosed in the <code> tag is immediately recognized by the browser as some type of coding language. Instead of trying to render that code, the browser understands that you are using that text as an example of the code for the purposes of an article or online tutorial.
                    
                    Using semantic tags gives you many more hooks for styling your content, too. Perhaps today you prefer to have your code samples display in the default browser style, but tomorrow, you might want to call them out with a gray background color; later still, you might want to define the precise mono-spaced font family or font stack to use for your samples. You can do all of these things easily by using semantic markup and smartly applied CSS.Although nearly every HTML4 tag and all the HTML5 tags have semantic meanings, some tags are primarily semantic.

                    For example, HTML5 has redefined the meaning of the <b> and <i> tags to be semantic. The <b> tag doesn't convey extra importance; rather, the tagged text is typically rendered in bold. Likewise, the <i> tag doesn't convey extra importance or emphasis; rather, it defines text that is typically rendered in italicsThe benefit of writing semantic HTML stems from what should be the driving goal of any web page: the desire to communicate.
